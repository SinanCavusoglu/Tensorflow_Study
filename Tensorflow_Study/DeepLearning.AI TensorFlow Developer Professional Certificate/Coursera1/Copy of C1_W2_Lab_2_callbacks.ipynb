This is a useful feature so you won't need to complete all epochs when this threshold is reached. For example, if you set 1000 epochs and your desired accuracy is already reached at epoch 200, then the training will automatically stop. Let's see how this is implemented in the next sections.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mcwrn9AKKVb8"},"source":["## Load and Normalize the Fashion MNIST dataset\n","\n","Like the previous lab, you will use the Fashion MNIST dataset again for this exercise.
