The validation accuracy is fluctuating and not trending up like the training accuracy. This might be because the additional training data generated still do not represent the features in the validation data. For example, some human or horse poses in the validation set cannot be mimicked by the image processing techniques that `ImageDataGenerator` provides. It might also be that the background of the training images are also learned so the white background of the validation set is throwing the model off even with cropping. Try looking at the validation images in the `tmp/validation-horse-or-human` directory (note: if you are using Colab, you can use the file explorer on the left to explore the images) and see if you can augment the training images to match its characteristics.
